# Multiagent DQN for collective learning
## Note
This is in Python 3.5.
Requirements: in requirements.txt + OpenCV

## Setting up
### Set up virtualenv
http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

### Download required packages
Activate your virtual environment, then issue this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Change euclid.py file
Euclid has some syntax that doesn't work in Python 3, so you need to change the file in the installed packages.
Go to your virtualenv folder > lib > python 3.5 > site-packages. Then replace euclid.py file there with the one in this repo.
